											<h2>How to cook healthy meals</h2>

											<p>Cooking healthy meals doesn’t have to be complicated, expensive, or time-consuming. One of the keys to maintaining your weight loss is building a routine that makes healthy eating both enjoyable and realistic for you. Adopting a few simple habits and approaches will make preparing nutritious meals easier, far more consistent, and sustainable.</p>

											<p>So, your first step in cooking healthy meals is the planning. This doesn’t mean that you must construct a detailed weekly menu though. Just planning two or three meals in advance can prevent you from making last-minute, unhealthy, eating choices. Keeping a short list of reliable, quick, nutritious meals—such as grilled chicken with vegetables, or baked fish, will help you to shop more intentionally - reducing the temptation to buy processed or high-calorie foods.</p>

											<p><strong>Balancing the food on your plate</strong> when preparing a main meal should include: half filling it with vegetables, then allocate a quarter to foods with lean protein like chicken or fish, and the other quarter to whole grains or starchy vegetables. This should ensure that you have varied and nutritious meals that you enjoy eating, without overcomplicating things. Vegetables add volume and fibre, proteins keep you full, and whole carbohydrates provide you with steady energy. Portion control plays a key role in maintaining a healthy weight, so consider switching to using smaller plates. Using this balanced approach for your lunches and dinners can prevent you overeating and overindulging in less healthy foods like carbohydrates.</p>

											<p>Healthy cooking is also about <strong>choosing the right techniques</strong> such as air frying, steaming, baking, grilling, and stir-frying with minimal oil. These approaches all help to keep the content of your meals lower in fat and calories, while preserving the flavour. Herbs and spices can be powerful additives too; they improve the taste of your cooked meals, without additional sugar or unhealthy fats. Try seasoning chicken with paprika and garlic, using lemon and dill on salmon, or experimenting with spices like turmeric, cumin, or smoked chilli.</p>

											<p>Consider trying <strong>batch cooking</strong> if you don’t do so already. Preparing larger quantities of healthy meals will save you time and makes good choices effortless later on. Batch-cooked soups, stews, or casseroles can be frozen for busy days when cooking from scratch feels overwhelming if you’ve busy home and work lives.</p>

											<p>If you’re going to make healthy meal choices that are sustainable over the coming years, choose foods you genuinely like, experiment with new recipes, and keep the various textures interesting. Trying new vegetables or different cooking styles can prevent boredom and help you stay engaged with maintaining your healthy eating habits.</p>

											<p>Cooking healthy meals over time is not about restricting the content and calories, but about creating routines and choices that nourish your body. With planning, simple techniques, balanced plates, and a bit of preparation, healthy eating will become both achievable and satisfying—supporting your long-term success in sustaining your weight loss.</p>
