											<h2>An Air Fryer is a great investment for healthy eating!</h2>

											<p>An air fryer might be the answer you’ve been looking for, to cook healthier meals with great tasting food. That’d be a worthwhile investment wouldn’t it?!  It could help you to lose pounds of weight, whilst saving you many £s too! Eating food that you want whilst maintaining a healthy lifestyle will help you feel like you are not ‘giving up’ on the food you enjoy. That will make it more likely that you will stick to your weight loss goals!</p>

											<p>Another advantage of an air fryer is portion control. Many air fryer baskets naturally hold just enough food for one or two portions, encouraging you to adopt more mindful eating by rebuilding your awareness of what an appropriate portion looks like.</p>

											<h3>Health benefits - which can (will?) support a healthier lifestyle and your weight loss</h3>


											<p><strong>•	Less fat and calories in your meals:</strong><br/>Air fryers have an in-built fan that circulates hot air at speed to cook your food. So you should then need little or no oil, compared to how much you might use if cooking in the oven or on your stove. So, for example, if you were to cook chips or roast potatoes with an air fryer you might use a tablespoon of oil at the most (and that could be a low calorie spray oil to save even more calories), compared to the many spoons of oil you’d need if you were deep frying or oven roasting your potatoes. Your resulting meal should have at least 80% fewer calories from the fat content but still deliver your favourite crispy foods. So with an air fryer you can enjoy eating golden-brown chips, crispy duck and/or crunchy roast potatoes for instance without any guilt about the excessive amount of calories.</p>

											<p><strong>•	Healthier alternatives: </strong><br/>Using an air fryer will encourage you to make healthier choices; enjoying lower-calorie versions of ‘fried’ food, as a swap from the deep-fried foods you used to cook – for you and your family.</p>

											<p><strong>•	More nutritious: </strong><br/>This air cooking approach preserves the vitamins and minerals in your food - especially vegetables (like parsnips, carrots and broccoli), compared to boiling or prolonged deep frying. The vegetables are more tasty too and eating more of them with a main meal should make you feel fuller for longer, and so help you to avoid snacking on high calories foods.</p>

											<p><strong>•	Convenience: </strong><br/>You should be able to cook food more quickly and easily with an air fryer, than when you use a conventional oven (as much as 30% quicker). So that should stop you being tempted to revert to ordering unhealthy takeaways during busy evenings and weekends at home or work. </p>

											<p><strong>•	Avoid carcinogens: </strong><br/>Acrylamide, is a potential carcinogen in some fried foods. The Food Standards Agency recommends that you ‘aim for a golden yellow colour or lighter when frying, baking, toasting or roasting starchy foods’. So air frying should make cooking foods a safer option.</p>

											<h3>Cost savings</h3>
											<p>The financial benefits of air fryers are that:</p>

											<p>•	you save on your spend on cooking oil..</p>

											<p>•	they use substantially less electricity than conventional ovens because they're smaller, preheat faster, and cook more quickly. Most run on about 1,400-1,700 watts compared to 2,000-5,000 watts for standard ovens – so much less costly.</p>

											<p>•	they can reduce food waste as you’ll be able to reheat any leftovers (better than microwaves), so it tastes freshly cooked rather than soggy.</p>

											<p>An air fryer typically costs between £50-150, so it doesn’t take long for it to pay for itself with your spend on oil and energy savings alone, let alone the time you save too. So your wallet and your waistline (hopefully) will both be much better for it!</p>
