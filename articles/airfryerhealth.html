											<h2>Using an Air Fryer to Cook Meals – Is It Healthier?</h2>

											<p>For anyone who has recently lost weight—whether through traditional calorie control, increased physical activity, or with the help of medications such as Ozempic or Mounjaro - one of the biggest challenges is keeping that weight off. Once the active phase of weight loss comes to an end, long-term success depends on building everyday habits that support healthier living. One practical and surprisingly powerful tool for maintaining weight is the air fryer, which offers a healthier, faster, and often cheaper way of cooking many favourite meals.</p>

											<p>Air fryers work by circulating hot air around food at high speed, creating a crisp outer texture with only a small amount of oil. This means you can enjoy foods that feel indulgent—crispy potatoes, crunchy chicken, or golden vegetables—while using a fraction of the fat and calories of deep fat frying. For people whose appetite may be returning after using medications like Ozempic or Mounjaro, being able to enjoy satisfying, flavourful meals without excess calories can help prevent gradual weight regain.</p>

											<p>A major benefit of air frying is the ability to recreate the textures people crave without heavy cooking methods. When you can still enjoy something crisp or crunchy while staying within a balanced eating plan, it becomes easier to stick to the healthy habits that supported weight loss in the first place. This can make a meaningful difference to long-term motivation and satisfaction.</p>

											<p>Air fryers are also quicker and <strong>more cost-effective </strong>than using a conventional oven. They heat almost instantly and cook food faster, reducing overall energy use and lowering electricity bills. In a world where time and money both matter, having a device that prepares a healthy meal in 10–15 minutes helps remove barriers that can lead to reaching for convenience foods. When healthy eating feels simple rather than time-consuming, it is far easier to maintain.</p>

											<p>Another advantage is <strong>portion control.</strong> Many air fryer baskets naturally hold just enough food for one or two portions, encouraging more mindful eating. For those adjusting to changes in appetite after weight-loss medication, this can be especially helpful in rebuilding awareness of what an appropriate portion looks like.</p>

											<p>Air frying also aligns well with eating patterns that support long-term weight maintenance. Lean proteins such as chicken breast, turkey or salmon, cook beautifully with minimal oil, while vegetables caramelise and crisp without needing butter or sugar.</p>

											<p>Even healthier versions of comfort foods—like homemade chips or lightly breaded chicken—can be included in a balanced diet when prepared in an air fryer.</p>

											<p>Of course, it is important to remember that an air fryer is a tool rather than a solution in itself. Processed food cooked in an air fryer is still processed food, and the focus should remain on whole, nutritious ingredients.</p>

											<p>For those maintaining weight after significant loss, the air fryer can become an invaluable kitchen ally: making meals healthier, quicker, cheaper, and easier—while supporting sustainable habits that truly keep the weight off.</p>
